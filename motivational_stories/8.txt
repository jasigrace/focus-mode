‘One afternoon, a fox was walking through the forest and spotted a bunch of grapes hanging from a lofty branch.

‘Just the thing to quench my thirst,’ he thought.

Taking a couple of steps back, the fox jumped and just missed the hanging grapes. The fox tried again but still failed to reach them.

Finally, giving up, the fox turned his nose up and said, ‘They’re probably sour anyway,’ and walked away.”
